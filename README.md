### source code
<p>A working source code is added in the repo. Test cases are added but are not thoroughly tested.
Before building the code, comment out the test cases as it may give some compilation erors. </p>

<p>Same ingestion code is executed in a jupyter notebook. And results are displayed.</p>

### jupyter notebooks
<p>There are 2 notebooks.</p> 
<p><strong>Data_ingestion.ipynb</strong> has all the source code for ingestion. All the cells are executed and putputs are displayed</p>
<p><strong>Data_exploration.ipynb</strong> is used for exploring the data and getting insights. Used matplotlib for create histograms, graphs etc. Output of both the notebooks are available for examination.</p>
